# BounceRender

My path tracer rendering engine, with a fresh new 2022 look ! âœ¨

## Why did I start a second take on an already unfinished project ?

[Bounce](https://github.com/ThomasVallentin/Bounce) was a learning project meant as a support topic to learn C++ and the basics of ray traced rendering. It has been done 100% from scratch and while it allowed me to discover many things from myself, the weakness of its fundations made it difficult to implement advanced features without rewriting it completelly.

This repository on the other hand is a more formal version of the project. It is based on the current standards of the industry (OpenColorIO, Alembic, Imath, Embree, TBB, OpenImageIO, Usd, etc...) and feature a full DCC to vizualize and edit the 3D scenes before sending them to the renderer.
